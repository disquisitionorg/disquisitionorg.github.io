                    <h2 class="chapter-title">Preface</h2>
                    <p>Electricity, as a subject of study, stands at the crossroads of physics, mathematics, and engineering. From the earliest observations of amber and lodestone to the systematic experiments of Coulomb, Faraday, and Maxwell, our understanding of electrical phenomena has evolved through centuries of curiosity, discovery, and refinement. This book, <em>Rudiments of Electricity: An Introductory Text in Basic Electrical Engineering</em>, is written in the spirit of those foundations. It aims to introduce the essential ideas of electricity as they first emerged from physics, and to guide the reader toward the structured analytical methods that define modern electrical engineering.</p>
                    
                    <p>The text begins with the basic concepts of electric charge, electric field, and electric potential, developing them not as abstract quantities but as natural consequences of physical interactions. By grounding these ideas in their historical and scientific origins, my intention is to make the subject intuitive and logically connected, enabling students to appreciate why the laws of electricity take the forms that they do.</p>
                    
                    <p>From these fundamentals, the book moves gradually to the applied side of the discipline: electric current, resistance, energy, and the behaviour of basic circuits. The core methods of elementary circuit analysis—including Kirchhoff's laws, equivalent transformations, and the study of simple networks—are presented with clarity and purpose, always building upon the physical principles introduced earlier. The aim is to help readers develop both conceptual understanding and practical analytical skill.</p>
                    
                    <p>Although the book assumes only a very basic knowledge of physics, it does rely on mathematics at the level of elementary calculus. Concepts such as derivatives and integrals are used where they naturally arise—for example, in defining current as the rate of flow of charge or in understanding the behaviour of capacitors and inductors. To support students who may need a concise refresher, a brief review of the relevant calculus ideas is included in the Appendix. While this text is not a mathematics book, it encourages the reader to appreciate the role of calculus as the language through which physical laws are expressed with precision.</p>
                    
                    <p>Throughout the chapters, I have attempted to retain a sense of the historical development of the subject. Electrical engineering did not emerge fully formed; it grew from experiments, questions, and gradual theoretical insight. By acknowledging this progression, I hope to inspire readers with the same sense of wonder that guided the pioneers of the field. If the reader can feel, even faintly, the motivation that once animated the early scientists and engineers, then the study of electricity becomes more than a technical requirement—it becomes a human and intellectual journey.</p>
                    
                    <p>This book is written for students encountering electrical engineering for the first time, especially those who wish to begin from the true foundations: the physics of charge and field, the reasoning behind the laws, and the methods by which electrical systems are analysed. It may serve as a primary text for a first course in basic electrical engineering or as a supplementary reference for self-guided learners.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ultimately, my hope is that this book will offer clarity where the subject often feels abstract, context where it may seem arbitrary, and motivation where it might otherwise appear mechanical. If it succeeds in providing its readers with a firm grounding in the rudiments of electricity—and in sparking a deeper curiosity about the field—then its purpose will have been fulfilled.</p>

                        <p>The concept of electric charge is one of the most fundamental in all of physics. It is the property of matter that gives rise to electrical phenomena—from the forces between particles to the flow of current in a circuit. Yet despite its ubiquity and importance, charge remains, in a sense, a primitive concept: we can describe its effects and measure its magnitude, but we cannot reduce it to anything more basic.</p>
                        
                        <p>Historically, the study of electricity began with simple observations. The ancient Greeks noticed that when amber was rubbed with cloth, it would attract light objects such as feathers or bits of straw. This phenomenon, though seemingly trivial, hinted at a deeper truth: that certain materials, when disturbed from equilibrium, acquire the ability to exert forces at a distance. The word "electricity" itself derives from the Greek word for amber, <em>ēlektron</em>.</p>

                        <p>Electric charge exhibits several fundamental properties that govern all electrical interactions. Understanding these properties is essential for grasping the behaviour of charged particles and the forces between them.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Conservation of Charge:</strong> One of the most important principles in physics is the law of conservation of charge. This law states that the total electric charge in an isolated system remains constant. Charge cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transferred from one object to another.</p>
